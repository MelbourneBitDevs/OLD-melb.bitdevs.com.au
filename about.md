# MelbBitdevs

Melbourne Bitdevs is on the last thursday of every month at the RMIT Blockchain Hub.

As a group, we discuss the latest Bitcoin news from a technical perspective. Sometimes we diverge into adjacent fields of privacy, self hosting, free software, and more!

**[Join the telegram](https://t.me/+6B_js_rFZ0syY2E1) in order to confirm the time of event - and be let upstairs!**

We usually have a larger group than meetup pages indicate. Privacy of attendees is respected, no photos/recordings.

## News items for this month

Please suggest any noteworthy topics for next month in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MelbourneBitDevs/MelbBitDevs/issues)! We're open to discussing pretty much anything Bitcoin or Bitcoin-adjacent!

## Group Activity

We aim to occasionally try new software or tutorials as a group, building applicable skills within a supportive group environment. So please try to bring a laptop machine along with you! MacOS or Linux preferred (for windows [you could use a virtual machine](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-windows-vmware-virtual-machine/)).
